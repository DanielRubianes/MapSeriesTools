# ArcGIS Pro Map Series Tools
A simple extension for ArcGIS pro, written in C#; Adds a set of buttons and panes to allow users to directly modify map series variables (particulary active/current page). This is especially useful for enterprise projects which involve complex page queries and overlapping frames.
